Help me make a plan for the code to acomplish this goal, don't give me code

Response:
Great question! Here's a step-by-step guide to build your Game of Thrones Ultimate Guide:
Phase 1: Planning & Setup
Step 1: Choose Your Tech Stack

Frontend: React (easier UI management) or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (simpler setup)
Backend: Node.js with Express (most common) or Python with Flask
API Choice: Start with Thrones API (has images built-in)

Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

Install Node.js (if not already installed)
Create project folder structure:

   got-guide/
   ├── backend/
   │   ├── server.js
   │   └── package.json
   └── frontend/
       ├── index.html
       ├── style.css
       └── app.js
Phase 2: Backend Development
Step 3: Build the Backend Server

Initialize Node.js project in backend/ folder
Install dependencies: express, cors, axios or node-fetch
Create endpoints:

GET /api/characters/:id - Get character by ID
GET /api/characters/search?name= - Search by name
GET /api/characters/count - Get total character count



Step 4: Implement API Logic

Fetch data from Thrones API
Handle pagination (next/previous with circular logic)
Implement search functionality with error handling
Add caching (optional but recommended)

Phase 3: Frontend Development
Step 5: Create the UI Structure

Design the character card layout
Add navigation buttons (Previous/Next)
Create search input field
Design error state screen

Step 6: Implement Frontend Logic

Fetch data from your backend
Handle state management (current character, loading, errors)
Implement circular navigation:

If at first character → Previous goes to last
If at last character → Next goes to first


Add search functionality with error handling

Step 7: Style Your Application

Make it responsive
Add GoT-themed styling (medieval fonts, colors)
Display family crests (if available in API)
Add loading states and transitions

Phase 4: Integration & Testing
Step 8: Connect Frontend to Backend

Make API calls from frontend to backend
Handle loading states
Display character information properly

Step 9: Test All Features

✅ Next/Previous navigation works
✅ Circular navigation at boundaries
✅ Search finds correct characters
✅ Error handling for invalid searches
✅ All character fields display correctly

Phase 5: Polish & Deploy
Step 10: Final Touches

Add transitions/animations
Optimize performance
Handle edge cases
Add README documentation
