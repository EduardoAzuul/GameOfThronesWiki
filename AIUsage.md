Response:
Great question! Here's a step-by-step guide to build your Game of Thrones Ultimate Guide:
Phase 1: Planning & Setup
Step 1: Choose Your Tech Stack

Frontend: React (easier UI management) or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (simpler setup)
Backend: Node.js with Express (most common) or Python with Flask
API Choice: Start with Thrones API (has images built-in)

Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

Install Node.js (if not already installed)
Create project folder structure:

   got-guide/
   ├── backend/
   │   ├── server.js
   │   └── package.json
   └── frontend/
       ├── index.html
       ├── style.css
       └── app.js
Phase 2: Backend Development
Step 3: Build the Backend Server

Initialize Node.js project in backend/ folder
Install dependencies: express, cors, axios or node-fetch
Create endpoints:

GET /api/characters/:id - Get character by ID
GET /api/characters/search?name= - Search by name
GET /api/characters/count - Get total character count



Step 4: Implement API Logic

Fetch data from Thrones API
Handle pagination (next/previous with circular logic)
Implement search functionality with error handling
Add caching (optional but recommended)

Phase 3: Frontend Development
Step 5: Create the UI Structure

Design the character card layout
Add navigation buttons (Previous/Next)
Create search input field
Design error state screen

Step 6: Implement Frontend Logic

Fetch data from your backend
Handle state management (current character, loading, errors)
Implement circular navigation:

If at first character → Previous goes to last
If at last character → Next goes to first


Add search functionality with error handling

Step 7: Style Your Application

Make it responsive
Add GoT-themed styling (medieval fonts, colors)
Display family crests (if available in API)
Add loading states and transitions

Phase 4: Integration & Testing
Step 8: Connect Frontend to Backend

Make API calls from frontend to backend
Handle loading states
Display character information properly

Step 9: Test All Features

✅ Next/Previous navigation works
✅ Circular navigation at boundaries
✅ Search finds correct characters
✅ Error handling for invalid searches
✅ All character fields display correctly

Phase 5: Polish & Deploy
Step 10: Final Touches

Add transitions/animations
Optimize performance
Handle edge cases
Add README documentation


QUESTION FOR AI
How could I make a header have the distance provided by a relaive component, while being fixed? ( No code)
Conceptually, what you’re describing means you want a fixed element (the header) — one that stays on screen when you scroll — but that also respects the document flow as if it were still relatively positioned (so the rest of the content “knows” where it is).

Here’s the key idea:

When you set an element to position: fixed, it’s taken out of the normal layout flow. That’s why the rest of the page doesn’t shift down — the header no longer occupies physical space in the document.

To make it appear as if it still does, while remaining fixed, the usual conceptual approach is:

Reserve its space manually.
Create an offset (like padding-top or a placeholder element) equal to the header’s height. This simulates its “relative” footprint in the layout.

Visually pin it to the top.
The header itself remains fixed so it stays visible when scrolling, but the rest of the layout is pushed down to start below it.

Synchronize those two layers.
If the header’s height can change (for example, it’s responsive or collapsible), you update the reserved space dynamically using JavaScript or CSS variables so that the offset always matches the header’s real size.
